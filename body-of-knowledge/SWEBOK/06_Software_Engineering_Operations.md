# Software Engineering Operations

> **Purpose:** This knowledge area covers the activities and tasks needed to deploy, operate, and support a software application while preserving its integrity and stability in production environments. Brand new in SWEBOK v4, it reflects the modern shift toward DevOps, infrastructure-as-code, and site reliability engineering—where software engineers increasingly own operational responsibilities traditionally handled by separate IT operations teams.

## Knowledge Areas

- **1. Fundamentals** — Defines software engineering operations, its core processes (planning, delivery, control), the role of the operations engineer, and foundational practices like scripting, automation, installation, testing/troubleshooting, and performance/load balancing.
- **2. Operations Planning** — Covers pre-deployment planning activities: operations plans and supplier management, development vs. production environment parity, service availability and continuity (SLAs), capacity management, backup/disaster recovery/failover, and security/integrity controls.
- **3. Operations Delivery** — Addresses the processes that deliver software into production: operational testing and verification, deployment/release engineering (including environment-based and application-based release strategies), rollback and data migration, change management, and problem management.
- **4. Operations Control** — Focuses on post-deployment monitoring and governance: incident management, continuous monitoring/measurement/tracking (KPIs and telemetry), operations support and service desks, and service reporting for stakeholders.
- **5. Practical Considerations** — Discusses incident and problem prevention through telemetry and analytics, operational risk management, end-to-end automation of operations, and adaptations of operations processes for very small organizations (ISO/IEC 29110).
- **6. Operations Tools** — Surveys the tooling landscape: containers and virtualization (orchestrators), deployment automation, automated testing across the delivery pipeline, and monitoring/telemetry frameworks with dashboards and analytics.

## Essential Concepts

- **DevOps** — Culture and practice of eliminating silos between development and operations; emphasizes shared processes, tools, and automation to achieve faster, higher-quality software delivery.
- **Operations Engineer** — A software engineer who develops operations services (provisioning, monitoring, deployment pipelines) exposed via APIs, enabling application developers to self-serve operational tasks without involving IT specialists.
- **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and Platform-as-Code (PaC)** — Managing infrastructure and platform configurations through version-controlled code, providing repeatability, consistency, known security policies, self-documentation, a single source of truth, and scalability.
- **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** — Role focused on monitoring, automating, and improving software operations for non-functional aspects (availability, performance, latency, security), including change management, emergency response, and capacity planning.
- **Platform Engineering** — Building and managing self-service platform capabilities that software engineers use to independently develop, deploy, and operate applications.
- **Release vs. Deployment** — Deployment is installing a specific software version to an environment; release is making features available to customers (often decoupled via feature toggles or staged rollouts like canary releases).
- **Canary Testing and Dark Launches** — Partial, time-limited deployments used to evaluate changes in production with minimal risk before full rollout; essential when full offline testing is impractical.
- **Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)** — Documented commitments defining service availability, performance targets, workload characteristics, and customer satisfaction metrics; the benchmark for operations service reporting.
- **Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment (CI/CD)** — Automated pipeline practices: CI builds/integrates code frequently; CD delivers release candidates to staging; continuous deployment pushes verified changes to production automatically.
- **Rollback and Data Migration** — Planned, rehearsed processes to revert software and databases to a known-good state when a deployment causes defects; modern DevOps automates rollback triggered by surveillance so end users may never notice a failure.
- **Change Management** — Controlled process of assessing, approving, implementing, and reviewing changes; DevOps shifts from large periodic releases toward small, independent, on-demand units of change.
- **Incident Management** — Recording, prioritizing, triaging, and closing software incidents; includes post-mortems and root-cause analysis to prevent recurrence; automation via alerts and logs prevents minor incidents from becoming major ones.
- **Operational Telemetry and KPIs** — Collecting data at all layers (application, OS, infrastructure) and using analytics to produce real-time dashboards of system health, end-user activity, security posture, and configuration changes.
- **Capacity Management** — Ensuring the product has sufficient capacity, at all times, to meet current and future demand; involves sizing, modeling, workload estimates, and a regularly updated capacity plan with costed options.
- **DevSecOps** — Integration of security mechanisms and tools early and throughout the software lifecycle, including at the operations level, to automate detection and correction of security issues as early as possible.

## Tools & Techniques Mentioned

- **Containers and Virtualization** — Container technologies and orchestrators (unspecified but implied: Docker, Kubernetes) to standardize deployment across environments and improve scalability.
- **CI/CD Pipelines** — Automated toolchains for integration, building, packaging, configuration, testing, deployment, and surveillance.
- **Scripting Languages** — Used to automate repetitive operational tasks (installation, configuration, directory creation, registry edits, environment variables) and as the basis for developing operations-as-a-service.
- **Feature Toggles** — Application-based release strategy using configuration parameters to enable or disable code sections without redeploying.
- **Canary Release Technique** — Partial, time-limited deployment of a change with automated evaluation before proceeding to full deployment.
- **Monitoring and Telemetry Frameworks** — Multi-layer data collection (application logs, OS execution traces, server resource metrics) combined with analytics (statistical analysis, machine learning) and stakeholder-specific dashboards.
- **Automated Testing** — Unit, integration, system, and user-acceptance tests automated throughout the delivery pipeline for continuous developer feedback.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD) / Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)** — Techniques ensuring operational testing begins during development, not just at the end.
- **Disaster Recovery and Failover** — Automated failover daemons, full/incremental backups, restore-point management, and regular rehearsals of recovery procedures.
- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 20000-1** — Reference standard for IT service management (service design, transition, delivery, improvement).
- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 32675** — DevOps standard covering Agile and MVP-perspective operations, including build, package, and deployment.
- **ISO/IEC 29110** — Lifecycle profiles and guidelines tailored for Very Small Entities (organizations of up to 25 people).
