# Topic 3: Sets, Relations, and Functions

The fundamental building blocks of discrete mathematics. Sets group objects; relations describe connections between them; functions map inputs to outputs deterministically. Together they underpin type systems, database theory, and all of data modeling.

## 1. Sets

A **set** is an unordered collection of distinct objects (elements). Denoted with curly braces: $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$.

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Notation | Meaning |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Element of | $x \in A$ | $x$ is in set $A$ |
| Not element of | $x \notin A$ | $x$ is not in $A$ |
| Subset | $A \subseteq B$ | Every element of $A$ is in $B$ |
| Proper subset | $A \subset B$ | $A \subseteq B$ and $A \neq B$ |
| Empty set | $\emptyset$ or $\{\}$ | Set with no elements |
| Cardinality | $|A|$ | Number of elements in $A$ |
| Power set | $\mathcal{P}(A)$ | Set of all subsets of $A$ |
| Universal set | $U$ | All elements under consideration |

### Set Builder Notation

$A = \{x \mid P(x)\}$ — "the set of all $x$ such that $P(x)$ is true."

Example: $E = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \text{ is even}\} = \{\dots, -2, 0, 2, 4, \dots\}$

### Set Operations

| Operation | Notation | Definition |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Union | $A \cup B$ | $\{x \mid x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}$ |
| Intersection | $A \cap B$ | $\{x \mid x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}$ |
| Difference | $A - B$ | $\{x \mid x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B\}$ |
| Complement | $\overline{A}$ | $\{x \in U \mid x \notin A\}$ |
| Cartesian product | $A \times B$ | $\{(a, b) \mid a \in A, b \in B\}$ |

### Set Properties

- **Commutative:** $A \cup B = B \cup A$, $A \cap B = B \cap A$
- **Associative:** $(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)$
- **Distributive:** $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$
- **De Morgan's Laws:** $\overline{A \cup B} = \overline{A} \cap \overline{B}$, $\overline{A \cap B} = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}$

### Venn Diagrams

Visual representations of sets as overlapping circles. Useful for understanding relationships between 2–4 sets.

**In code:** Sets map to `Set`/`HashSet` collections. Set operations become `union()`, `intersection()`, `difference()`. SQL's `JOIN` is a Cartesian product with a filter.

## 2. Relations

A **relation** $R$ from set $A$ to set $B$ is a subset of $A \times B$ — a collection of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. If $(a, b) \in R$, we write $a R b$.

### Properties of Relations (on a set $A$)

| Property | Definition | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Reflexive | $\forall a \in A: a R a$ | $=$ on numbers |
| Symmetric | $a R b \implies b R a$ | "is sibling of" |
| Antisymmetric | $a R b \land b R a \implies a = b$ | $\leq$ on numbers |
| Transitive | $a R b \land b R c \implies a R c$ | $<$ on numbers |

### Special Relation Types

- **Equivalence relation:** Reflexive + Symmetric + Transitive — partitions a set into equivalence classes (e.g., "has the same remainder modulo $n$")
- **Partial order:** Reflexive + Antisymmetric + Transitive — defines a hierarchy (e.g., $\subseteq$ on sets, divisibility on integers)

**In code:** Relations model database foreign keys (`ORDER.customer_id → CUSTOMER.id`), graph edges, and comparison operators. Equivalence classes are used in union-find / disjoint-set data structures.

## 3. Functions

A **function** $f: A \rightarrow B$ is a special relation where **every element of $A$ maps to exactly one element of $B$**.

- $A$ = **domain** (inputs)
- $B$ = **codomain** (allowed outputs)
- $f(A)$ = **range** (actual outputs)

### Function Properties

| Property | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| Injective (one-to-one) | $f(a_1) = f(a_2) \implies a_1 = a_2$ — distinct inputs → distinct outputs |
| Surjective (onto) | $\forall b \in B, \exists a \in A: f(a) = b$ — every output is hit |
| Bijective | Both injective and surjective — perfect one-to-one correspondence |

### The Vertical Line Test

On a graph, a curve represents a function iff any vertical line intersects it at most once. This is the visual check that each $x$ maps to exactly one $y$.

**In code:** Functions **are** deterministic computation. Pure functions in programming ($f(x)$ always returns the same output for the same input) are mathematical functions. Injective = unique keys in a hash map; bijective = invertible (encryption/decryption pairs).

## Why This Matters in SE

| Concept | SE Application |
|---------|---------------|
| Sets | Type systems (`int`, `string` are sets of values), collections, database relations |
| Set operations | SQL (`UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`), filtering, deduplication |
| Cartesian product | Nested loops, combinatorial test generation, `CROSS JOIN` |
| Relations | Foreign keys, graph databases, state transition tables |
| Equivalence relations | Hashing (same hash = same equivalence class), partitioning |
| Functions | Pure functions, deterministic APIs, mapping, lambda expressions |
| Bijection | Serialization/deserialization, encoding schemes, perfect hashing |
