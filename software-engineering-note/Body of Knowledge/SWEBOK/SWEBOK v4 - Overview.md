# SWEBOK v4 — Software Engineering Body of Knowledge

> **Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge v4.0**
> IEEE Computer Society, 2024 | Editor: Hironori Washizaki
> 18 Knowledge Areas | 413 pages

## What Is This?

The **Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK)** is the IEEE Computer Society's authoritative guide defining what constitutes the software engineering discipline. It describes, organizes, and provides topical access to the *generally accepted knowledge* of software engineering — knowledge applicable to most projects most of the time, with broad consensus about its value and usefulness. It is not the body of knowledge itself (which lives in published literature), but the canonical map of that terrain.

Version 4, released in 2024 and edited by Hironori Washizaki, updates the 2014 V3 edition with over 130 reviewers from across the globe. Every chapter has been refreshed to incorporate modern practices — Agile, DevOps, AI/ML, IoT, and continuous delivery appear throughout. Three knowledge areas are entirely new, and all existing areas have been revised for currency, consistency, and readability. The result is a 413-page reference that serves five explicit objectives: promote a consistent worldwide view of software engineering, specify its scope, characterize its contents, provide topical access, and serve as a foundation for curriculum development, certification, and licensing.

The 18 Knowledge Areas are organized into a two-level hierarchy of topics and subtopics, designed to be compatible with major schools of thought and industry practice without favoring any single methodology, application domain, or business model. Each chapter includes a reference matrix connecting cited works to specific topics, making SWEBOK a living gateway into the deeper literature.

## The 18 Knowledge Areas

### 🔧 Core Engineering
- [[01_Software_Requirements]] — Elicitation, analysis, specification, validation, and management of requirements; the battle against incompleteness and ambiguity that drives exponentially cascading rework if lost.
- [[02_Software_Architecture]] — 🆕 new in v4 — Fundamental concepts, views and viewpoints, patterns, styles, ADLs, and structured evaluation of the high-level structure that shapes everything downstream.
- [[03_Software_Design]] — The transformation of requirements into implementable specifications through design principles, three stages (architectural, high-level, detailed), strategies, methods, and quality evaluation.
- [[04_Software_Construction]] — The hands-on craft of creating software: detailed design, coding, verification, unit/integration testing, debugging, reuse, TDD, and AI-assisted programming.
- [[05_Software_Testing]] — Dynamic validation across test levels, techniques, measures, and processes — the largest chapter at 35 pages, spanning from unit tests to AI/ML system testing.
- [[06_Software_Engineering_Operations]] — 🆕 new in v4 — Deployment, operation, and support of production software: DevOps, IaC, SRE, CI/CD, platform engineering, and incident management.
- [[07_Software_Maintenance]] — The totality of post-delivery activities (corrective, adaptive, perfective, preventive, emergency) consuming over 80% of total lifecycle cost — and the processes to manage that cost effectively.

### 📋 Management & Process
- [[08_Software_Configuration_Management]] — Identifying, controlling, and tracking software artifacts through version control, baselines, change control, status accounting, audits, and release management.
- [[09_Software_Engineering_Management]] — Planning, estimating, measuring, controlling, and risk management for delivering software products efficiently — where management without measurement lacks discipline.
- [[10_Software_Engineering_Process]] — How engineers organize work through life cycle models (waterfall, spiral, Agile), process categories, process assessment (CMMI, SPICE), and continuous improvement (PDCA).

### 🎯 Quality & Cross-Cutting
- [[11_Software_Engineering_Models_and_Methods]] — Modeling principles, structural and behavioral models, and the full landscape of development methods from heuristic and formal to prototyping and Agile.
- [[12_Software_Quality]] — Quality fundamentals, SQA, V&V, defect management, dependability for safety-critical systems, and the economics of conformance vs. nonconformance.
- [[13_Software_Security]] — 🆕 new in v4 — Building security into software across the entire SDLC: threat modeling, secure coding (CERT Top 10), security testing, vulnerability management (CVE/CWE/CVSS), and DevSecOps.

### 👤 Professional Practice
- [[14_Software_Engineering_Professional_Practice]] — Professionalism, ethics, group dynamics, psychology, and communication skills — the non-technical foundations of responsible, accountable engineering practice.
- [[15_Software_Engineering_Economics]] — The science of choosing how to invest limited resources for maximum value: ROI analysis, estimation techniques, for-profit/nonprofit decision-making, and total cost of ownership.

### 🧮 Foundations
- [[16_Computing_Foundations]] — Computer architecture, data structures & algorithms, programming paradigms, operating systems, databases, networks, HCI, and AI/ML — the computing bedrock under all software engineering.
- [[17_Mathematical_Foundations]] — Logic, proof techniques, set theory, graphs & trees, FSMs, the Chomsky hierarchy, probability, numerical methods, and algebraic structures for rigorous specification and verification.
- [[18_Engineering_Foundations]] — The engineering mindset: iterative problem-solving, abstraction and encapsulation, empirical and statistical methods, measurement theory, standards, and root cause analysis.

## What's New in V4

Since V3 (2014), the SWEBOK has been comprehensively updated:

- **Three new Knowledge Areas** — Software Architecture (split from Design into its own KA with ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 foundations), Software Security (covering the full secure development lifecycle from threat modeling to DevSecOps), and Software Engineering Operations (reflecting the industry shift to DevOps, SRE, and platform engineering).
- **Agile and DevOps integrated throughout** — No longer treated as alternative methodologies but as mainstream practices embedded in nearly every KA.
- **AI, ML, and IoT** — Integrated into Computing Foundations as a full section, with domain-specific testing and security concerns threaded through Testing, Security, and Operations chapters.
- **Modern system types** — References to enterprise/cloud, embedded/IoT, and AI/ML-based systems appear where practices diverge across system types.
- **Updated standards and tools** — All chapters refreshed with current standards (ISO/IEC 25010:2023, ISO/IEC 15408:2022, ISO/IEC 27001:2022) and modern tools (LLM-assisted programming, container orchestration, CI/CD pipelines).
- **Enhanced professional practice** — Coverage of GDPR, CCPA, equity/diversity/inclusivity, and modern intellectual property concerns.

## How to Use This Vault

Each Knowledge Area is a self-contained chapter, but they are deeply interconnected through [[wikilinks]]. All chapters follow a consistent structure:

1. **Purpose** — What the KA covers and why it matters
2. **Knowledge Areas** — The hierarchical topic breakdown
3. **Essential Concepts** — The 10–15 most important ideas in digestible form
4. **Tools & Techniques** — What practitioners use
5. **Related SWEBOK Chapters** — Wikilinks to connected KAs

Start with [[00_Introduction]] for definitions, scope, and how the Guide is structured. Then explore by need — the [[wikilinks]] at the bottom of every chapter will pull you naturally into related areas. The vault is designed for both linear study and targeted reference.
