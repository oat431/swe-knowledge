# Unit Testing

> *"Test code is just as important as production code. It is not a second-class citizen. It requires thought, design, and care. It must be kept as clean as production code."*
> — Robert C. Martin, p. 124

> *"Tests enable all the -ilities, because tests enable **change**."*

## Three Laws of TDD

Uncle Bob defines three laws that lock you into a ~30-second cycle. Tests and production code are written *together*, with tests only seconds ahead.

### **First Law**
You may not write production code until you have written a **failing unit test**.

### **Second Law**
You may not write **more** of a unit test than is sufficient to fail — and **not compiling is failing**.

### **Third Law**
You may not write **more** production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.

These laws produce a tight red-green-refactor loop. Over months, they generate thousands of tests that rival the size of the production codebase itself — making test cleanliness a critical management concern.

---

## Keeping Tests Clean

### **Tests Are Change-Enablers**
Dirty tests are **worse than no tests**. Without a clean test suite:
- Changes become feared → production code rots
- Defect rate rises → customers grow frustrated
- The test suite becomes a liability and is eventually **discarded**

> *"If you let the tests rot, then your code will rot too."* — p. 133

### **Test Code = Production Code**
Tests demand the same standards: thoughtful naming, short functions, clean design, and disciplined refactoring. They are **not** a license to write "quick and dirty" code.

---

## Clean Tests: Readability Matters

> *"What makes a clean test? Three things. Readability, readability, and readability."*
> — p. 124

A clean test says a lot with few expressions. The **BUILD-OPERATE-CHECK** pattern makes structure obvious.

### Before (noisy, low readability)

```java
public void testGetPageHieratchyAsXml() throws Exception {
    crawler.addPage(root, PathParser.parse("PageOne"));
    crawler.addPage(root, PathParser.parse("PageOne.ChildOne"));
    crawler.addPage(root, PathParser.parse("PageTwo"));
    request.setResource("root");
    request.addInput("type", "pages");
    Responder responder = new SerializedPageResponder();
    SimpleResponse response =
        (SimpleResponse) responder.makeResponse(
            new FitNesseContext(root), request);
    String xml = response.getContent();
    assertEquals("text/xml", response.getContentType());
    assertSubString("<name>PageOne</name>", xml);
    assertSubString("<name>PageTwo</name>", xml);
    assertSubString("<name>ChildOne</name>", xml);
}
```

### After (BUILD-OPERATE-CHECK, domain language)

```java
public void testGetPageHierarchyAsXml() throws Exception {
    makePages("PageOne", "PageOne.ChildOne", "PageTwo");     // BUILD
    submitRequest("root", "type:pages");                      // OPERATE
    assertResponseIsXML();                                    // CHECK
    assertResponseContains(
        "<name>PageOne</name>",
        "<name>PageTwo</name>",
        "<name>ChildOne</name>"
    );
}
```

The refactored version eliminates `PathParser` noise, response casting, and URL-building trivia — the reader grasps intent in seconds.

---

## Domain-Specific Testing Language

Evolve a **testing API** through continuous refactoring. Don't design it up front; extract helper functions (`makePages`, `submitRequest`, `assertResponseContains`) as tests grow tainted by obfuscating detail. This language:
- Makes tests **shorter to write** and **easier to read**
- Hides the production API behind intent-revealing names
- Serves future maintainers who must understand the tests

---

## Dual Standard

Test code operates under a **different engineering standard** than production code:

| Dimension        | Production Code             | Test Code                  |
|------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Performance**  | Must be efficient           | Can sacrifice CPU/memory   |
| **Readability**  | Must be clean               | Must be **even cleaner**   |
| **Simplicity**   | Required                    | Non-negotiable             |

Small performance shortcuts (e.g., string concatenation over `StringBuffer`) are acceptable in tests because the test environment is not resource-constrained. Cleanliness, however, is **never** compromised.

### Before (eye-bouncing assertions)

```java
@Test
public void turnOnLoTempAlarmAtThreashold() throws Exception {
    hw.setTemp(WAY_TOO_COLD);
    controller.tic();
    assertTrue(hw.heaterState());      // eye bounces left → assertTrue
    assertTrue(hw.blowerState());      // eye bounces left → assertTrue
    assertFalse(hw.coolerState());     // eye bounces left → assertFalse
    assertFalse(hw.hiTempAlarm());
    assertTrue(hw.loTempAlarm());
}
```

### After (single, scannable assertion)

```java
@Test
public void turnOnLoTempAlarmAtThreshold() throws Exception {
    wayTooCold();
    assertEquals("HBchL", hw.getState());
    //            │││││
    //            ││││└─ lo-temp-alarm:  L=on, l=off
    //            │││└── hi-temp-alarm:  H=on, h=off
    //            ││└─── cooler:         C=on, c=off
    //            │└──── blower:         B=on, b=off
    //            └───── heater:         H=on, h=off
}
```

The encoded state string lets the reader **glide** across assertions. Used sparingly, this is an acceptable trade-off. A full suite becomes trivially scannable:

```java
@Test public void turnOnCoolerAndBlowerIfTooHot()    { tooHot();    assertEquals("hBChl", hw.getState()); }
@Test public void turnOnHeaterAndBlowerIfTooCold()    { tooCold();   assertEquals("HBchl", hw.getState()); }
@Test public void turnOnHiTempAlarmAtThreshold()      { wayTooHot(); assertEquals("hBCHl", hw.getState()); }
@Test public void turnOnLoTempAlarmAtThreshold()      { wayTooCold();assertEquals("HBchL", hw.getState()); }
```

---

## One Assert per Test

A **guideline**, not an inviolable rule. Strive to **minimize** asserts rather than dogmatically limit to one.

Split tests with the **given-when-then** convention when it improves clarity:

```java
// Two focused tests instead of one multi-assert test
public void testGetPageHierarchyAsXml() throws Exception {
    givenPages("PageOne", "PageOne.ChildOne", "PageTwo");
    whenRequestIsIssued("root", "type:pages");
    thenResponseShouldBeXML();
}

public void testGetPageHierarchyHasRightTags() throws Exception {
    givenPages("PageOne", "PageOne.ChildOne", "PageTwo");
    whenRequestIsIssued("root", "type:pages");
    thenResponseShouldContain(
        "<name>PageOne</name>", "<name>PageTwo</name>", "<name>ChildOne</name>"
    );
}
```

When one-assert-per-test forces excessive duplication (base classes, `@Before` overhead), **multiple asserts are the pragmatic choice**.

---

## Single Concept per Test

> *"Probably the best rule is that you should minimize the number of asserts per concept and test just one concept per test function."*
> — p. 132

A test that exercises **three independent scenarios** forces the reader to decode which section tests what:

```java
// BAD: tests three unrelated concepts in one method
public void testAddMonths() {
    // Concept 1: May 31 + 1 month → June 30
    SerialDate d1 = SerialDate.createInstance(31, 5, 2004);
    SerialDate d2 = SerialDate.addMonths(1, d1);
    assertEquals(30, d2.getDayOfMonth());
    assertEquals(6, d2.getMonth());
    assertEquals(2004, d2.getYYYY());

    // Concept 2: May 31 + 2 months → July 31
    SerialDate d3 = SerialDate.addMonths(2, d1);
    assertEquals(31, d3.getDayOfMonth());
    assertEquals(7, d3.getMonth());
    assertEquals(2004, d3.getYYYY());

    // Concept 3: May 31 + 1 month + 1 month → July 30
    SerialDate d4 = SerialDate.addMonths(1, SerialDate.addMonths(1, d1));
    assertEquals(30, d4.getDayOfMonth());
    assertEquals(7, d4.getMonth());
    assertEquals(2004, d4.getYYYY());
}
```

Split into separate, well-named tests — one concept each. This also reveals **missing test cases**: incrementing February 28 should yield March 28, not March 31.

## F.I.R.S.T. Principles

Clean unit tests follow these five rules:

### **Fast**
Tests must run **quickly**. Slow tests → infrequent runs → late bug discovery → reluctance to clean code → rot.

### **Independent**
No test should set up conditions for another. Tests must run in **any order**. Dependent tests cause cascading failures that hide root causes.

### **Repeatable**
Tests must run in **any environment**: production, QA, laptop on a train without network. Environment-dependent tests give you an excuse for failure.

### **Self-Validating**
Tests output a **boolean**: pass or fail. No manual log inspection. No diffing text files. Subjective validation kills automation.

### **Timely**
Tests are written **just before** the production code that makes them pass. Writing tests after production code leads to untestable designs and the temptation to skip testing "hard-to-test" code.
