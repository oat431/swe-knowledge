# 14 Miller's Law

> **The average person can hold 7 ± 2 items in working memory.**

Humans have limited short-term memory. Chunk information into groups of 5–9 items to make it manageable. This is why phone numbers are grouped (XXX-XXX-XXXX) and credit card numbers are in 4-digit chunks.

## What "7 ± 2" Actually Means

It's not that you can only show 7 things. It's that you should **chunk** information into groups, with each group containing 5–9 items at most.

| Without Chunking | With Chunking |
|-----------------|---------------|
| 1234567890 | 123-456-7890 (3 chunks of 3–4 digits) |
| A 30-item settings page | 5 categories × 6 settings each |
| A wall of form fields | 3 sections: Personal, Address, Payment |

---

## In Practice

### Navigation

| ❌ | ✅ |
|----|-----|
| 12 items in main navigation | 5–7 items; rest in dropdowns |

### Forms

| ❌ | ✅ |
|----|-----|
| 15 fields in one block | Grouped into "Personal Info" (5 fields), "Address" (5 fields), "Payment" (5 fields) |

### Content

| ❌ | ✅ |
|----|-----|
| A single long paragraph | Bullet points (3–7 per group), headings, white space between sections |

### Phone Numbers / Codes

| ❌ | ✅ |
|----|-----|
| "Enter code: 837261" | "Enter code: 837 261" (chunked) |

## The Real Limit: Don't Obsess Over 7

Modern research suggests the real limit may be closer to **4 ± 1** for complex information. The principle matters more than the exact number:

> **Break complex information into smaller, meaningful groups. Test whether users can hold the information in their head.**
