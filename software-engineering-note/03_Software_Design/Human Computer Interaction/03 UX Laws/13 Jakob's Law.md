# 13 Jakob's Law

> **Users spend most of their time on OTHER websites. They prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.**

Don't reinvent the wheel. Users bring mental models from every other app they've used. If your app breaks those models, they'll struggle — no matter how "innovative" your design is.

## The Principle

![Jakob's Law - users expect your site to work like others](https://lawsofux.com/images/jakobs-law.svg)

## What Users Expect (Because Every Other Site Does It)

| Expectation | Violating It |
|------------|-------------|
| Logo top-left → clicking it goes home | Logo elsewhere = confusion |
| Navigation at top or left | Navigation at bottom or right = "where's the menu?" |
| Search icon = magnifying glass | Custom search icon = users can't find search |
| Blue underlined text = link | Black non-underlined links = "is that clickable?" |
| Shopping cart icon top-right | Cart bottom-left = "where's my cart?" |
| Hamburger menu on mobile | Custom menu icon = "how do I navigate?" |
| Red = error/danger, Green = success | Swapped colors = dangerous misinterpretation |

## When to Break Jakob's Law

You CAN deviate — but only when your new pattern is **significantly better** AND you teach users the new behavior.

| ✅ Worth Breaking Convention | ❌ Not Worth It |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Pull-to-refresh (was new, now standard) | Custom scrollbar design |
| Swipe-to-delete on mobile (now standard) | Bottom-placed logo |
| Infinite scroll (for feeds) | Red "Confirm" button |

> **Innovate on VALUE, not on INTERACTION PATTERNS.** Your app should solve problems differently, not navigate differently.

## Practical Rules

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Use existing design systems | Material Design, Apple HIG — users already know them |
| Copy patterns from category leaders | Your banking app should work like other banking apps |
| Test with real users | "It's intuitive" = "it works like things I already use" |
| Standard icons, standard positions | A floppy disk = save. A gear = settings. Don't get creative with these. |
