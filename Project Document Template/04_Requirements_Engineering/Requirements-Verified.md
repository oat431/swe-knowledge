## 1. Purpose

> This document records the verification of requirements against quality characteristics defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148. Verification ensures requirements are well-formed *before* they are used for design and development.

## 2. Verification Criteria

### 2.1 Quality Characteristics

| Characteristic | Definition | Verification Method |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Atomic** | [One requirement per statement] | [Peer review — split compound requirements] |
| **Complete** | [All attributes filled, no gaps] | [Checklist — every field populated] |
| **Consistent** | [No contradictions with other requirements] | [Cross-reference review] |
| **Feasible** | [Technically and economically achievable] | [Technical review, cost analysis] |
| **Unambiguous** | [One interpretation only] | [Peer review, 3 amigos] |
| **Necessary** | [Traces to business objective] | [Traceability check] |
| **Prioritized** | [MoSCoW assigned] | [Stakeholder review] |
| **Testable** | [Acceptance criteria defined] | [AC review, QA sign-off] |
| **Traceable** | [Linked to source and downstream] | [RTM check] |
| **Modifiable** | [Structured for easy updates] | [Document structure review] |

### 2.2 Verification Scoring

| Rating | Score | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| ✅ Pass | [Fully meets criterion] | [No action needed] |
| ⚠️ Partial | [Meets with minor gaps] | [Action item created] |
| ❌ Fail | [Does not meet criterion] | [Must fix before baseline] |

> **Template Standard:** Based on BABOK v3, ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148, ISO/IEC 20246
> **Usage:** Verify requirements *before* baseline. Verification checks *form* (are they well-written?). Validation checks *substance* (are they the right requirements?). Both must pass before development begins.
